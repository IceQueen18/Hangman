Hangman is a simple word-guessing game. The player has to guess a hidden word by suggesting letter, one at a time. Here's how it works:

How to Play

Setup:

A random word is chosen (e.g., galaxy).
You are given a set number of attempts (usually 6).
The word is hidden with underscores (_ _ _ _ _ _).

Gameplay:

Guess one letter at a time.
If the letter is in the word, it is revealed.
If the letter is not in the word, you lose one attempt.
The game keeps track of all your guessed letters.

Winning:

If you guess all the letters in the word before running out of attempts, you win!

Losing:

If you run out of attempts, you lose, and the word is revealed.
